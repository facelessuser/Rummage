# User Guide

## Overview

Rummage is designed to be easy to pick up. Rummage's interface consists of three tabs: Search, Files, and Content.  In general, a user specifies where they want to search, what they want to search for, and optionally what they want to replace it with.  Search features can be tweaked with toggles, and the files that get searched can be narrowed with filters.  Search and replace options are all contained in the **Search** tab.  As matches are found, general info about the matches will be displayed in the **Files** and **Content** tab.

Rummage also comes with a simple regular expression tester to test out patterns. It also provides a feature where patterns can be saved for later and/or frequent use.

The status bar will show search status such as match counts and other useful information.

!!! warning "Warning: Replace"
    When replacing, Rummage will back up the file.  If the copy fails, it should terminate the replace for that file.  You can disable backups if you like, but if you aren't careful with your patterns, you may remove unwanted text that you won't be able to recover unless you are using version control.

    This is free software, and I am not responsible for files corrupted or lost.

    See [Backups](#backups) to learn more about backups and how to customize backups.

## Running

After installation, you should then be able to access Rummage from the command line.  This assumes the Python bin directory is in the path.

```bash
rummage
```

Or specify a path:

```bash
rummage --path mydirectory
```

### Regular Expression Libraries Used

Rummage uses the default regular expression library ([Re][re]) that comes with the version of Python you are using. It also optionally works with the 3rd party [Regex][regex] library as well.

Rummage also provides an optional, wrapper called [Backrefs][backrefs] which augments Re and Regex and adds support for various new back references, and adds some new features.  Additions differ depending on which library Backrefs is augmenting. See [Backrefs' documentation][backrefs] for more info.

To provide a consistent user experience there are a few differences between libraries that are normalized. In Python, there is a difference between how back slashes are handled in strings (`#!py3 "..."`) and raw strings (`#!py3 r"..."`). Rummage inputs can be thought of as raw string inputs. Normal Regex replace templates allows for character back references in raw string, replace templates (`\u0057`, `\x057`, etc.), but Re and Regex format replacement templates do not (Regex raw string format templates won't convert normal references like `\n` either). When Backrefs is applied, all replacement templates will support and translate character references, but Rummage will also ensure that normal Re and normal Regex format replace work the same.

## Search Tab

![Search Tab](/images/search_tab.png)

The **Search** tab is broken up into 2 panels, the first of which is the **Search &amp; Replace** panel. The **Search &amp; Replace** panel has all the inputs where the search and replace is defined and configured.  It also has access to the regular expression tester and the save/load dialogs for saving/loading patterns for later use.

The second panel, is the **Limit Search** panel.  The **Limit Search** panel contains toggles and inputs that filter the files to be searched.

## Files Tab

![Files Tab](/images/files_tab.png)

The **Files** tab is where files with matches are shown after a search completes.  The files are arranged in a sortable table.  Each entry will show the file's name, size, number of matches in the file, the file path, detected file encoding, date/time when the file was created, and date/time of when the file was last modified.

When mousing over an entry, the full path to the file will be shown in the status bar.  If you have the editor option in the preference dialog configured properly, you can double click an entry to open to the first match of that file in your favorite editor.

Right clicking the entries will bring up a context menu as well allowing you to reveal the file in your operating system's file manager, delete files, copy file paths, and calculate the checksum of a file (available checksum options will vary depending on your Python system).

## Content Tab

![Content Tab](/images/content_tab.png)

The **Content** tab shows each match in a file individually. The entries will be arranged in a sortable table. Each entry shows the file's name, the line on which the match was found, the number of matches on that line, and the content of the line.  Long lines will be truncated.

When mousing over an entry, the full path to the file will be shown in the status bar.  If you have the editor option in the preference dialog configured properly, you can double click an entry to open to that specific match of that file in your favorite editor.

Right clicking the entries will bring up a context menu as well allowing you to reveal the file in your operating system's file manager, delete files, copy file paths, and calculate the checksum of a file (available checksum options will vary depending on your Python system).

## Search &amp; Replace Panel

![Search and Replace Panel](/images/search_replace_panel.png)

The **Search &amp; Replace** panel contains three text boxes with a dropdown history. The first text box defines **where to search**, the second defines **what to search for**, and the last defines **what to replace matches with** (this is only needed when doing replaces).  You can select previously used patterns and search targets by expanding the dropdown panel for the input.

Below the text boxes are toggles that control the regular expression engine's flags and/or features.  These will vary depending on which regular expression engine you are using as Rummage can be used with Python's default [Re][re] engine or the third party [Regex][regex] engine.  Both optionally can use the a special wrapper called Backrefs to add support for a couple special escapes.

Underneath the regular expression flags, are toggles for general Rummage search features.  These will alter search and/or replace behavior.

Lastly, Rummage provides buttons to launch a regular expression tester dialog or dialogs to save or load frequently used regular expressions.

### Common Regular Expression Flags

Both the Re and Regex engine have a couple of shared flags that are exposed in Rummage. These toggles are found directly under the search and replace text boxes.

Toggle                      | Description
--------------------------- | -----------
Search\ with\ regex         | Alters the behavior of `Search for` and `Replace with`.  When this is checked, both text boxes require regular expression patterns opposed to literal string.
Search\ case-sensitive      | Forces the search to be case-sensitive.
Dot\ matches\ newline       | `.` will also match newlines.
Use\ Unicode\ properties    | Changes the behavior of `\w`, `\W`, `\b`, `\B`, `\d`, `\D`, `\s`, and `\S` to use use characters from the Unicode property database (will also modify `\l`, `\L`, `\c`, and `\C` in search patterns if using Backrefs with Re).
Format\ style\ replacements | Replace pattern will use [a string replace format][format-string] for replace. `#!py3 "{1} {1[-2]} {group_name[-3]}"` etc. This is not available for Re without Backrefs, and is limited when using Re with Backrefs. Read more about format mode [here][backrefs-format]. And remember that Rummage normalizes mentioned differences in Backrefs' and Regex's handling of back slash escapes in format replace mode.

### Regex Engine Flags

If the Regex engine is being used for regular expressions, a couple of extra toggles will be available. Regex can be run in either `VERSION0` or `VERSION1` mode.  `VERSION0` is compatible with Re regular expression patterns and has the extra `fullcase` toggle.  `VERSION1` does not have this toggle as it is enabled by default and can only be disabled inline via a pattern with `(?-f)`. `VERSION1` is not directly compatible with Re patterns as it adds a number of changes to the syntax allowing for more advanced search options.

Toggle                      | Description
--------------------------- | -----------
Best\ fuzzy\ match          | If performing a fuzzy match, the *best* fuzzy match will be used.
Improve\ fuzzy\ fit         | Makes fuzzy matching attempt to improve the fit of the next match that it finds.
Unicode\ word\ breaks       | Will use proper Unicode word breaks and line separators when Unicode is enabled. See Regex documentation for more info.
Use\ POSIX\ matching        | Use the POSIX standard for regular expression, which is to return the leftmost longest match.
Search\ backwards           | Search backwards. The result of a reverse search is not necessarily the reverse of a forward search.
Full\ case-folding          | Use full case folding. For Regex `V0` only as it is enabled by default for `V1`.

### Rummage Flags

Rummage has a couple of flags that are not specific to the regular expression engine.

Toggle                  | Description
----------------------- | -----------
Boolean\ match          | Will check each file up until the first match and will halt searching further.  No line context info will be gathered or displayed. Does not apply when performing replaces.
Count\ only             | Will just count the number of matches in the file and will not display line context information. This has no effect when applying replaces.
Create\ backups         | On replace, files with matches will be backed up before applying the replacements; backup files will have the `.rum-bak` extension.
Force\ &lt;encoding&gt; | Forces all files to be opened with the specified encoding opposed to trying to detect the encoding.  Encoding is hard and slow, so this is the preferred method for fast searches.  On failure, binary will be used instead.
Use\ chain\ search      | Puts Rummage into ["search chain" mode](#search-chains). When in "search chain" mode, rummage will only use saved search chains for search and replace.
Use\ replace\ plugin    | When enabled, Rummage will use a [replace plugin](#replace-plugins) instead of a replace pattern in order to do more advanced replaces.

### Regular Expression Tester

![Regex Tester](/images/regex_tester.png)

Rummage comes with a simple regular expression tester (but you can also test literal patterns if desired). It has a simple multi-line text box to place content to search, and another multi-line box that will show the final results after the find and replace are applied.  Below that you will find two text input boxes for the find pattern and the replace pattern.  Lastly, all search and replace flag toggles are found under the patterns.

To use the tester, simply enter the content to search, set your desired toggles, and input your find and replace pattern.  As you change your pattern or change your toggles, matches will be updated and highlighted, and the result box will be updated.

When you are satisfied with your result, click the `Use` button, and your pattern and settings will be populated in the main window.

### Saving and Loading Regular Expressions

Regular expressions can be very complex, and sometimes you might want to save them for future use to save yourself from having to reconstruct them.

When you have a pattern configured that you want to save, simply click the `Save Search` button, and a dialog will pop up asking you to name the search.  When done, click the `Save` button on the dialog and your search patterns and toggles will be saved.

You'll notice that there are two input boxes. The first requires a unique name (only word characters, underscores, and hyphens are allowed). The second is an optional comment in case you wish to elaborate on what the pattern is for.

Underneath the inputs will be the actual search settings being saved.  All of the search settings will be in read only controls.

![Save Search](/images/save_search.png)

To load a pattern that was saved previously, click the `Load Search` button.  You will be presented with a dialog showing all your saved searches.  Highlight the pattern you want to load and click the `Load` button.  Your pattern and toggles will be populated in the main dialog.

If you wish to edit the name or comment of a search, you can double click the entry or click the "Edit" button.

![Load Search](/images/load_search.png)

### Search Chains

There are times you may have a task that requires you to do multiple find and replaces that are all related, but are too difficult to represent as a single find and replace. This is where search chains can be helpful.

Search chains are essentially a sequence of multiple [saved search and replace patterns](#saving-and-loading-regular-expressions). You can create a search chain by clicking the `Search Chains` button which will bring up the search change manager.

![Chain Button](/images/chain_button.png)

Here you can create or delete search chains.

![Search Chains](/images/chains.png)

To use search chains you must put Rummage in "search chain" mode by selecting the check box named `Use search chains` in the main window. When "search chain" mode is enabled, all controls that don't apply to search chains will be disabled, and the search box will be replaced with a drop down for selecting created chains. When a search is performed, Rummage will iterate over each file with all the saved searches in the chain.

![Chain Select](/images/chain_mode.png)

### Replace plugins

Regular expressions are great, but sometimes regular expressions aren't enough.  If you are dealing with a replace task that requires logic that cannot be represented in a simple replace pattern, you can create a "replace plugin".

Replace plugins are written in Python and are loaded by first selecting the `Use plugin replace` check box in the main dialog.

![Enable Replace Plugin](/images/plugin_toggle.png)

Then the main dialog's `Replace with` text box will become the `Replace plugin` text box with an associated file picker.  Here you can point to your replace plugin file.

Replace plugins aren't meant to be full, complex modules that import lots of other relative files.  They are meant to be a single, compact script, but inside that script, you can import anything that is *already* installed in your Python environment.

![Enable Replace Plugin](/images/plugin_input.png)

#### Writing a Plugin

Replace plugins should contain two things. The first is a plugin class derived from the `rummage.lib.rumcore.ReplacePlugin`.  The second is a function called `get_replace` that returns your class.

The plugin class is fairly straight forward and is shown below.

```py3
class ReplacePlugin(object):
    """Rummage replace plugin."""

    def __init__(self, file_info, flags):
        """Initialize."""

        self.file_info = file_info
        self.flags = flags
        self.on_init()

    def on_init(self):
        """Override this function to add initialization setup."""

    def get_flags(self):
        """Get flags."""

        return self.flags

    def get_file_name(self):
        """Get file name."""

        return self.file_info.name

    def is_binary(self):
        """Is a binary search."""

        return self.file_info.encoding.encode == 'bin'

    def is_literal(self):
        """Is a literal search."""

        return self.flags & LITERAL

    def replace(self, m):
        """Make replacement."""

        return m.group(0)
```

`ReplacePlugin`'s `replace` function will receive the parameter `m` which is either a `regex` or `re` match object (depending on what regular expression engine is selected). The return value must be either a Unicode string or byte string (for binary files).

The `ReplacePlugin`'s `file_info` property is a named tuple providing information about the current file such as name, size, creation date, etc.

```py3
class FileInfoRecord(namedtuple('FileInfoRecord', ['id', 'name', 'size', 'modified', 'created', 'encoding'])):
    """A record for tracking file info."""
```

The `ReplacePlugin`'s `flags` property contains only Rummage search related flags (the flags are abstracted at this level and are converted to the appropriate regular expression flags later). They can also be accessed from `rummage.lib.rumcore`. The flags are shown below.

```py3
# Common regular expression flags (re|regex)
IGNORECASE = 0x1  # (?i)
DOTALL = 0x2      # (?s)
MULTILINE = 0x4   # (?m)
UNICODE = 0x8     # (?u)

# Regex module flags
ASCII = 0x10            # (?a)
FULLCASE = 0x20         # (?f)
WORD = 0x40             # (?w)
BESTMATCH = 0x80        # (?b)
ENHANCEMATCH = 0x100    # (?e)
REVERSE = 0x200         # (?r)
VERSION0 = 0x400        # (?V0)
VERSION1 = 0x800        # (?V1)
FORMATREPLACE = 0x1000  # Use {1} for groups in replace
POSIX = 0x2000          # (?p)

# Rumcore search related flags
LITERAL = 0x10000           # Literal search
```

!!! example "Example Plugin"
    In the example below, we have a replace plugin that replaces the search result with the name of the file.  It is assumed this is not a binary replace, so a Unicode string is returned.

    ```py3
    from __future__ import unicode_literals
    from rummage.lib import rumcore
    import os


    class TestReplace(rumcore.ReplacePlugin):
        """Replace object."""

        def replace(self, m):
            """Replace method."""

            name = os.path.basename(self.get_file_name())
            return name


    def get_replace():
        """Get the replace object."""

        return TestReplace
    ```

## Limit Search Panel

![Limit Search Panel](/images/limit_search_panel.png)

The limit search pattern contains inputs and toggles to filter which files will be searched.  Some people may like to set up the filters and hide the panel.  If this is desired, you can select in the window's menu **View-->Hide Limit Search Panel**, and the panel will be hidden.

Limiter                | Description
---------------------- |------------
Size\ of               | Limits files that are searched by size in Kilobytes.  Files are limited by whether they are greater than, less than, or equal to the specified size.  Setting the dropdown to `any` disables the filter and allows any file size to be searched. It is recommended to cap search sizes in projects with very large files for the best performances.  The more complex the search pattern, the longer it will take to search a really large file.
Modified               | Limits the files to be searched by the modified timestamp.  It contains a date picker and time picker that are used to specify the target date and time. Files are limited by whether their timestamp comes before, after, or on specified date time.  Setting the dropdown to `on any` will disable the filter and allow a file with any timestamp to be searched.
Created                | Limits the files to be searched by the creation timestamp.  It contains a date picker and time picker that are used to specify the target date and time. Files are limited by whether their timestamp comes before, after, or on specified date time.  Setting the dropdown to `on any` will disable the filter and allow a file with any timestamp to be searched.
Files\ which\ match    | Specifies a file pattern for files that should be searched.  Multiple file patterns can be specified with `;` used as a separator. If the Regex toggle to the text box's right is selected, the file pattern must be a regular expression pattern.  You can select previously used patterns by expanding the dropdown panel for the input.
Exclude\ folders       | Specifies a directory exclude pattern to filter out folders that are not to be crawled.  Multiple file patterns can be specified with `;` used as a separator.  If the Regex toggle to the text box's right is selected, the file pattern must be a regular expression pattern.  You can select previously used patterns by expanding the dropdown panel for the input.
Include\ subfolders    | Indicates that folders should be recursively searched.
Include\ hidden        | The given OS's native hidden files, folders and dotfiles will be included in the search.
Include\ binary\ files | Forces Rummage to search binary files.

!!! tip "Tip"
    If you don't specify a search pattern, Rummage will use your file filter and just show files that match your file filter pattern.

## Export to CSV or HTML

![HTML Export](/images/html_export.png)

Rummage allows the exporting of the results to either CSV or HTML.  Simply select **File-->Export** and pick either **CSV** or **HTML**.  The HTML output will be styled similar to the GUI interface with the results in tables with sortable columns.

!!! info "Large Result Sets":
    Really, really large sets of results will probably be best suited for CSV as a browser may have a hard time loading the entire data set at once.

## Preferences

The preference dialog (found at **File-->Preferences**) is where general application settings are available. The preference dialog organizes settings by tabs.

### General

![Preferences: General](/images/settings_general.png)

The **General** tab contains a couple of useful settings.

Single Instance
: 
    By default, Rummage will allow for multiple windows to be open.  If this option is enabled, the first window will be be the only window to open.  All subsequent instances will pass their arguments to the first and close without showing a window.

Language
: 
    Rummage has internal support to display dialog labels in different languages. Currently Rummage has English. Russian is outdated but includes most of the needed translations. In order to use locale, you must copy the project's localization files to your user settings directory. See [Localization](#localization) to learn more.

Updates
: 
    Controls whether Rummage will check for new updates daily and allows controlling whether you want to be notified of prereleases as well. A button has also been provided to check for updates right away after configuring your update settings.

    The check is only a check for new versions and doesn't perform an upgrade.  Rummage must be upgraded via `pip` from command line.

    !!! info "Update Issues: Python 3.6+ on macOS"
        There is a small issue on macOS with Python 3.6+: Python 3.6 changed how it gets the default certificates required to properly check URLs. The details are actually documented here: https://bugs.python.org/issue28150#msg276516.

        To get access again to the default certificates is actually quite easy. Assuming that Python 3.6+ was installed using the macOS installer from Python.org, you just need to navigate to `/Applications/Python 3.6/Install Certificates.command` and double click the command.  The script will use `pip` to install `certifi` and creates a symlink in the OpenSSL directory to `certifi`'s installed bundle location. If you are using something like macports, then you'll probably have to research to find out how to do the same thing.

### Regex

![Preferences: Regex](/images/settings_regex.png)

The **Regular Expression Modules** panel is where the desired regular expression engine that Rummage uses can be selected and configured.  By default, Rummage will use Re, but if Regex module is installed in your Python installation, it can be selected instead.  There is also the options of using Re or Regex with [Backrefs](#backrefs-extended-regex-escapes) (a wrapper that adds a couple of special escapes).

If using Regex, you can set it to version of your choice. `V0` tries to be completely compatible with Re patterns while `V1` breaks compatibility with Re and adds even more useful features. Please see [Regex documentation](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/regex/) to learn more.

### Encoding

![Preferences: Encoding](/images/settings_encoding.png)

The **Encoding** panel is where you can tweak encoding detection. You can change the default encoding detection used (assuming you have both Chardet and cChardet installed). By default, Rummage will use the fastest (cChardet).

Special encoding file type considerations are also exposed here. File extensions assigned to either HTML, XML, or Python will use special logic to look for encoding declarations in the file's header, while file extensions assigned to binary will shortcut the encoding selection to binary. Just double click the file type whose extensions you would like to modify.

Remember that encoding detection is far from bulletproof and can pick an incorrect encoding. While during searches it might not be as big an issue, it is strongly suggested you use a forced encoding when performing replaces.

### Editor

![Preferences: Editor](/images/settings_editor.png)

The **Editor** panel is where an editor can be configured that will be used to show files for editing.  To setup, click the `Change` button.  You will be presented with a dialog. Simply provide the appropriate command to open files and click `Apply`.

![Editor Options](/images/editor_options.png)

The editor options dialog has a file picker to select the the editor.  In macOS it may be beneficial to create a shell script or symlink that you can references as the picker won't be able to descend into an `.app` bundle as it is viewed as a file instead of a folder.

You can then add arguments.  Each argument must be added as a separate entry.  So something like `--file myfile.txt` would be counted as **two** arguments while `--file=myfile` would be counted as one.

As noted in the image above, Rummage provides 3 special variables that can be used to insert the file name, line number, or column number.

Argument Variables | Description
------------------ | -----------
`{$file}`          | Insert the file name.
`{$line}`          | Insert the line number.
`{$col}`           | Insert the column number.

### Notifications

![Preferences: Notifications](/images/settings_notify.png)

The **Notification** panel controls enabling/disabling and configuration of notifications.  You can enable/disable visual notifications and/or audible notification sounds.

You can also select whether to use the system's built-in notifications or Growl.

Ubuntu
: 
   - Growl: [Support for Linux][growl-linux].
   - Native: OSD via `notify-send`.

    !!! info "Other Distros"
        Though Rummage should run on any Linux distro, the native dialog option was built around Ubuntu's native notifications called OSD.  Notifications will not work on other distros that do not use OSD *unless* they use Growl.  Even without Growl, other distros will probably still get the audible cue, but as each distro varies, it is difficult to be certain.  As notifications are not crucial to usage, this is minor concern.

macOS
: 
    - Growl: [Support for macOS][growl-macos].
    - Native: Notification Center via [terminal-notifier][terminal-notifier]. Path to `terminal-notifier` must be configured.

    !!! info "Configuring macOS Native"
        When selecting `native` on macOS, an option to select the path to terminal notifier will be available since native dialogs rely on `terminal-notifier` to send notifications to the Notification Center. This must be configured or *native* notifications will not work.

        When selecting the `terminal-notifier` path, you can select either the binary directly or the `.<app` bundle (depending on how you installed `terminal-notifier`).  When selecting the `.app` bundle, Rummage will know how to access the binary inside the bundle.

Windows
: 
    - Growl: [Support for Windows][growl-win].
    - Native: Native windows taskbar notifications.


### History

![Preferences: History](/images/settings_history.png)

The **History** panel is where all text box, drop down history can be cleared.

### Backups

![Preferences: Backups](/images/settings_backup.png)

The **Backups** panel allows you to configure where Rummage creates backups. You can control whether backups are all placed in the same folder as the original source, or if they are put into a subfolder. You can also configure the name of the subfolder used or the extension used when not writing to a subfolder.

## Import/Export Settings

If desired, Rummage's settings can be exported to a JSON file or imported from a JSON file.  This can be particularly useful for importing regular expression patterns from one system into another system's existing regular expression list. This can also be useful if you have a lot of regular expression patterns you wish to create, and it would be too cumbersome to do it through the GUI.  In the latter case, you could construct the pattern configurations in a JSON file and import all the patterns in one shot.

Import and export are broken up into three types of settings: general settings, chains, and searches. General settings are the basic feature configurations for Rummage.  Chains contains all of your configured pattern chains.  And searches is the actual configured search and replaces.  When exporting, you will be presented with a dialog allowing you to select which categories of settings you wish to export.

![Settings: Export](/images/settings_export.png)

When importing, you will be prompted to select the settings file to import.  Then you will be asked to select one or more settings categories to import.  Rummage will skip any malformed or invalid settings. If you are going to overwrite an existing chain or search, it will prompt you whether to proceed with the overwrite.  Afterwards, it will output the import results in the text box.

![Settings: Export](/images/settings_import.png)

The general settings are meant to be transferred between installations, not specifically configured by hand, so all the supported settings will not be covered here, but the chain and search format will be discussed in details.

The chain format for importing is shown below:

```js
{
    "chains": {                 // The key that denotes this setting is the "chains" setting.
        "a-chain": [            // Unique chain ID.  Must be composed of letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens.
            "example-1",        // A list of references to specific unique search IDs.
            "example-2"
        ],
        "another-chain": [
            "example-3",
            "example-4"
        ]
    }
}
```

The search/replace format for importing is show below:

```js
{
    "saved_searches": {                                         // The key that denotes this setting is the "chains" setting.
        "Copyright-update": {                                   // Unique search ID.  Must be composed of letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens.
            "flags": "is",                                      // Search and replace flags (covered below).
            "is_function": false,                               // Boolean stating whether the replace pattern is a function or not.
            "is_regex": true,                                   // Boolean stating whether the search pattern is a regular expression or literal string.
            "name": "Copyright update",                         // A more user friendly name or description of the pattern.
            "replace": "\\g<1>16",                              // The replace pattern, or in case `is_function` is `true`, the path to the Python replace plugin file.
            "search": "(Copyright \\(c\\) \\d+ - 20)(\\d{2})"   // The search pattern.
        }
    }
}
```

Below is a table containing valid flags for the `flags` parameter.  Literal searches only allow flags `i`, `u`, and `f`.  Regular expression patterns can use `i`, `u`, `f`, `s`, `b`, `e`, `w`, `r`, `p`, and `F` (though flags are applicable depending on whether you are using Re, Regex, or one of the two with Backrefs).

Flags | Supported\ Libraries                       | Option
----- | ------------------------------------------ | -----------
`i`   | All                                        | [Search case-sensitive.](#common-regular-expression-flags)
`u`   | All                                        | [Use Unicode properties.](#common-regular-expression-flags)

## Backrefs (Extended Regex Escapes)

Rummage has the option of using a special wrapper called Backrefs around Python's Re or the 3rd party Regex module. Backrefs was written specifically for use with Rummage and adds various additional back references that are known to some regex engines, but not to Python's Re or Regex modules.  The supported back references actually vary depending on the engine being used as one may already have similar support.  You can enable extended back references in the **Preferences** dialog under the [Regular Expressions Module](#regular-expression-modules) panel.

To learn more about the added back references when using Backrefs, read the official [Backrefs documentation][backrefs].

#### Backups

Rummage by default does a backup of files on replace when `Create backups` is enabled in the main dialog. Backups are saved in the same location as the target file with the unique extension `rum-bak` appended to them.  When `Create backups` is enabled, files with the extension `rum-bak` are ignored in search and replace in order to avoid replacing content in your backup.

If desired, Rummage can be configured to store backups in a sub-folder at the target file's location by setting the `Backup to folder` option in the setting dialog. The backup folder will be named `.rum-bak`.  When this is done, all files in `.rum-bak` will have the `bak` extension. The entire folder `.rum-bak` is excluded from search and replace when `Create backups` is enabled.

If you would like, you can control the backup extension in the settings dialog and/or the backup folder name.  Remember though, when saving backups to a sub-folder, the custom extension will not be applied and `bak` will be used as the whole folder is ignored eliminating the need for a unique extension.

## File Manager Context Menu

### macOS

- Open Automator.
- Create new Service.
- Set the following:
    - Service receives selected `files or folders` in `any Application`.
    - Shell: `/bin/sh`.
    - Pass input: `as arguments`.
    - Content of script:

        ```
        (/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/rummage --path "$1")>/dev/null 2>&1 &
        ```

        This is just an example. You will need to determine the location of your Python install.

- Save to `/Users/<username>/Library/Services/Rummage Here...`.

### Windows

- Create a file `rummage.reg` and put the following in it (replace &lt;rummage_path&gt; path with the actual path to   `rummage.exe` that is created in your Python Script folder on installation).  Remember to escape backslashes appropriately.  This isn't a guide in how to do registry editing proper, so only edit the registry if you are certain of what you are doing.

    ```ini
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

    [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Folder\shell\Rummage Here...]
    @=""

    [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Folder\shell\Rummage Here...\command]
    @="\"<rummage_path>\" \"--path\" \"%1\""

    [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\Rummage Here...]
    @=""

    [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\Rummage Here...\command]
    @="\"<rummage_path>\" \"--path\" \"%1\""

    ```

- Save file.
- Double click the registry file to add the context menu into Windows Explorer.

### Linux

There are many different flavors of Linux using different file managers.  This makes it difficult to give a guide to cover all cases.  Please research about your specific distro's file manager and how to add context menus.  If you would like to include the info here, please issue a pull request to update the documentation.

#### Ubuntu Nautilus

Paths might vary depending on Ubuntu version etc.

- Create an executable file called `Rummage Here...` in `~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/` with the following content (RUMMAGE_PATH should be the binary created when installing rummage in Python which is usually `/usr/local/bin/rummage`).

    ```py3
    #!/usr/bin/python
    import os
    import subprocess

    RUMMAGE_PATH = "/usr/local/bin/rummage"

    selected_paths = os.environ.get("NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS", None)
    if selected_paths is not None:
        paths = selected_paths.split("\n")
        if len(paths):
            subprocess.Popen([RUMMAGE_PATH, "--path", paths[0]])
    ```

- Restart of Nautilus may or may not be needed, but context menu item should appear under `Scripts` and should work on files and folders.

## Localization

Rummage provides an i18n localization framework to allow support for displaying the UI in other languages. But there is some manual setup required as out of the box, everything is in English. Currently the project only has an incomplete Russian translation (I don't speak Russian, so I can't complete it).

So to get localization, you must first build the `.mo` files on your system, copy them to your Rummage setting folder, select your desired language in the preference dialog, and restart Rummage.


### Build Translations

Download the release source and unzip it.

Compile `.mo` files by running the `tools/localize_me.py` script from the root of the project:

```
python3 tools/localize_me.py --i18n /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/share/doc/python3.6/examples/Tools/i18n
```

Modify the `--i18n` path to the appropriate location of the `i18n` folder for your Python.


### Installing Translations

To install translations, just copy the `locale` folder (with your compiled `.mo` files) from the release you are using to your user configuration folder.  For a traditional Python installation, this is where you'd find it for each OS:

Windows: `C:\Users\<my_username>\.Rummage`
macOS: `/Users/<my_username>/.Rummage`
Linux: `/home/<my_username>/.config/Rummage`

Unless the UI changes by adding new untranslated strings, you can keep using the same translations.

After installing the localization files, set the language via the `Language` setting in the settings [General panel](#general).

### Adding New Translations

- Clone the project and create a new folder under `locale` with the appropriate locale name.
- Create another folder under the one you just created called `LC_MESSAGES`.
- Copy `locale/messages.po` to `locale/<my_LOCALE>/LC_MESSAGES/rummage.po`.
- Edit the copied file changing things like:

    ```
    msgid "About"
    msgstr ""
    ```

    To:

    ```
    msgid "About"
    msgstr "<my_translation>"
    ```

- Compile by following steps in [Build Translations](#build-translations).

- Commit, push, and pull request.


I only speak English, so I do not maintain the translations. If the UI changes, someone from the community will need to update them appropriately via pull requests or they will remain out of date.
