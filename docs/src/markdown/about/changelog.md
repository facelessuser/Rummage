# Changelog

## 4.11.1

- **FIX**: Internal color fixes.
- **FIX**: Fix Rummage crashing with wxPython 4.1.X due to image sizing bug on macOS.
- **FIX**: Resolve issue where changelog would not show after an update.

## 4.11.0

- **NEW**: `wcmatch` the file search library that Rummage uses, is now at version 6 which imposes a pattern limit to
  protect against patterns such as `{1..1000000}` which would expand to a large amount of patterns if brace expansion
  is enabled. Rummage exposes control of this.
- **FIX**: By using `wcmatch` version 6, complex issues involving pattern splitting with `|` and `{,}` are resolved.
- **FIX**: Fix logo not loading in about dialog.

## 4.10.0

- **NEW**: Pattern save dialog now uses a drop down list so you can easily update an existing saved pattern.
- **FIX**: Fix issue with web view rendering and `pymdown-extensions`.

## 4.9.0

- **NEW**: Require `wcmatch` 5.1.0+, `bracex` 1.4.0, and `backrefs` `1.3.0` to include latest bug fixes.

## 4.8.0

- **NEW**: Supports installing extras via `pip install rummage[extras]`.
- **FIX**: Fix for notification sound display in settings dialog.
- **FIX**: Fix notification sound not playing on Linux when configured.

## 4.7.1

- **FIX**: Require `wcmatch` 5.0 and make adjustments to support it.

## 4.7.0

!!! warning "Warning"
    Backrefs 4.2.0 has deprecated the shorthand references for alphabetic character groups in `re` search patterns: `\l`, `\L`, `\c`, and `\C`. Instead you should use: `[[:lower:]]`, `[[:^lower:]]`, `[[:upper:]]`, and `[[:^upper:]]` respectively. While the references have only been deprecated, and are technically still available, a future version of Backrefs will remove them entirely at some point. It is recommended to transition now so as not to be caught unawares.

- **NEW**: Add `col0` variable for editor configuration to allow for using a zero based column value instead of one based column value for editors that require it.
- **NEW**: Add global option to turn off alternating row colors in lists.
- **NEW**: Provide support for different players on Linux: `paplay`, `aplay`, and `play` (`sox`). Supported sound formats vary.
- **NEW**: Provide interface for selecting custom notification sounds.
- **NEW**: Require `wcmatch` 4.3.1+ and `backrefs` 4.2.0+.
- **FIX**: Better attempt to get appropriate file creation time on all Linux systems.
- **FIX**: Better fix for time picker getting wrong background.
- **FIX**: Ensure column sizing includes header size.
- **FIX**: When showing timed status event for results in status bar (full path name), decrease length of time that the temporary status is shown and clear temporary status when the cursor leaves result items.
- **FIX**: Don't log handled notification errors when a notification system is not found as these are handled gracefully and there is no need to worry the user.

## 4.6.3

- **FIX**: Notification audio failures should be handled gracefully.
- **FIX**: Sometimes abort doesn't work.

## 4.6.2

- **FIX**: Fix issue where time control used a completely different font and font size.

## 4.6.1

- **FIX**: Fix issues with time control not properly inheriting system colors.
- **FIX**: Fix time control sizing on Linux.
- **FIX**: Fix time control issue on Linux and macOS that prevents decrement button from decrementing past initial value.

## 4.6.0

- **NEW**: Search options and file limit options can be collapsed in the main dialog. This allows  hiding these options if you aren't frequently using them, and provides a more compact dialog.
- **NEW**: There is no longer an option to hide the file limit options as now you can just collapse them.
- **NEW**: Added context menu option to allow reordering of columns in the result lists. Positions are remembered across sessions.
- **FIX**: Fix an issue on Linux where tabbing past a hidden directory button would cause an error in GTK. Ensure such controls do not allow focus when they are hidden.
- **FIX**: Fix an internal error where the autocomplete box could throw an error due to the index bounds not being checked.
- **FIX**: When list controls are smaller than the window, don't resize last column too an excessively big width.
- **FIX**: Fix regression with loading replace plugins.
- **FIX**: Better initial focus in autocomplete text boxes on platforms that had issues.
- **FIX**: Fix some localization issues.

## 4.5.0

- **NEW**: Add **Match base** search option. **Match base** affects full path patterns when **Full path directory match** or **Full path file match** is enabled. When a full path pattern has no slashes, it will cause the pattern to only match the base file name. This allows you to have traditional base match patterns and more specific full path patterns usage simultaneously. Requires `wcmatch` 4.0 which is now the minimum requirement.
- **FIX**: Ensure settings version is upgraded properly.

## 4.4.1

- **FIX**: Increase performance by reducing number of `stat`/`lstat` calls during crawls.

## 4.4.0

## 4.3.2

- **FIX**: Require Backrefs 4.0.1 which includes a number of bug fixes, particularly one that sometimes caused Backrefs not to install properly.

## 4.3.1

- **FIX**: Python file encoding detection should default to the Python 3 assumed default, not Python 2.
- **FIX**: Consolidate internal HTML logic and avoid using base 64 encoded images if using latest Markdown extensions that include path conversion fix.
- **FIX**: Refresh status less to improve on overall speed.
- **FIX**: Simplify status: no need to display `ACITVE` or `DONE` as button will change back to `Search` to signify completion along with the display of the `Benchmark` or even the notification if enabled.
- **FIX**: Ensure single file search with no pattern works like multi-file search with no pattern (just return file).
- **FIX**: Minor cleanup and performance increase in core.
- **FIX**: When search error dialog is shown from the status bar, fix error with window destruction.

## 4.3.0

- **NEW**: Documents are now included locally in installation and can be viewed directly in Rummage via a `webview` dialog.

- **FIX**: Require Backrefs 3.1.2. Some bug fixes, but notably, Backrefs switched from using `\<` and `\>` for start and end word boundaries to `\m` and `\M`.  This is because of an oversight as Python versions less than 3.7 would escape `<` and `>` in `re.escpae` (even though it is unnecessary). Also some Unicode table generation fixes.
