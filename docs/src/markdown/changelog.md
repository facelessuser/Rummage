# Changelog

## 2.1.0

> Jul X, 2017

- **NEW**: Add new chained search feature.
- **NEW**: Add new replace plugin support.
- **NEW**: Restructure internal API to support chained search.
- **NEW**: Saved searches will now require a unique name and an optional comment. Old legacy saves will be converted on first access. The old legacy name will be the comment, and a unique name will be generated from the comment.
- **NEW**: Saved search names and comments can be edited from the "Load Search" panel.
- **NEW**: Internal API no longer will guess and decode strings, only files.  It is expected that the caller handles encoding of string buffers.  A Unicode buffer will be searched as usual, and a binary string buffer will be treated as binary.
- **NEW**: Tester dialog will now process literal searches as well.
- **NEW**: Literal searches will now utilize the Unicode related flags. This is particularly notable if using the Regex module and wanting to have full case-folding applied in case-insensitive matches.
- **FIX**: Visual inconsistencies in regard to text box size relative to siblings, alignment of labels, etc.
- **FIX**: Content text box in tester dialog will now allow entering tab characters on all platforms instead of navigating to next control.
- **FIX**: Fix wxPython deprecation noise in the console.
- **FIX**: Fix some binary related replace issues.
- **FIX**: Fix search not aborting.
