    Get the version (PEP 440).

    Version structure
      (major, minor, micro, release type, pre-release build, post-release build)
    Release names are named is such a way they are sortable and comparable with ease.
      (alpha | beta | candidate | final)

    - "final" should never have a pre-release build number
    - pre-releases should have a pre-release build number greater than 0
    - post-release is only applied if post-release build is greater than 0
    - development-release is only applied if `.dev-` is appended to release type.
      It can be applied to pre and post releases. Intention is to only use this internally
      and never actually release a `dev` to the public server. As we don't manage build releases,
      we will just use `dev0`.

    Acceptable version releases:

    ~~~
    (1, 0, 0, 'final', 0, 0)      1.0
    (1, 2, 0, 'final', 0, 0)      1.2
    (1, 2, 3, 'final', 0, 0)      1.2.3
    (1, 2, 0, 'alpha', 4, 0):     1.2a4
    (1, 2, 0, 'beta', 4, 0):      1.2b4
    (1, 2, 0, 'candidate', 4, 0): 1.2rc4
    (1, 2, 0, 'final', 0, 1)      1.2.post1
    (1, 2, 0, 'beta', 1, 1):      1.2b1.post1
