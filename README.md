Rummage
=======

Rummage is a GUI for grep like searches in python.  It was inspired by the tool I use in windows called GrepWin found here: http://stefanstools.sourceforge.net/grepWin.html.  I mainly used the tool for searches, and I wanted a similar tool in OSX...so I wrote Rummage.  The feel is loosely based off of GrepWin, though currently it has no replace options (not sure if/when I will add replace).  It is written in Python; therefore, it will be slower on searches than it would be if the searching were written in C (maybe down the line).  The big reason I wrote this is so I can build a similar tool on both OSX, Windows, and/or Linux (though I haven't yet tested Linux).

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/facelessuser/Rummage/wiki/Rummage-Documentation) for documentation.

For help and support, or to see what is planned next, see the the [Issues](https://github.com/facelessuser/Rummage/issues?state=open) page.
